	 <p> I believe in simple solutions. It does not matter if the problem in hand is small or large. I always strive to deliver something simple and elegant to the end users which would be intuitive and performs as best as possible. 
I started my first professional job during my first year in undergrad. I was building online learning solutions for PCi Corporation, which was later acquired by Wolters Kluwer. My experience started to broaden while contributing to solutions outside my initial project, which were application built on early versions of Salesforce and was written in JSP. In 2003-2004 time I started working in Microsoft .Net platform as that just came into market building an e-learning solution for local market in Bangladesh. Afterwards I started picking up PHP and MySQL to build small web applications for small businesses. I got back to .Net development with full stack application development in 2006 as I built a federated authentication platform for a client which I also showcased as my undergrad final project, that got me into top 5th percentile in project score.</p>
<p>
Right after I completed school, I converted my part-time gig to full-time in Pageflakes Inc, an award-winning web 2.0 startup, in 2006. I was working on core system front-end and widget development using Asp.Net AJAX and custom JavaScript frameworks. My front-end development focus carried onwards to my other development roles with ShareFlow.com and British Telecom. </p>
<p>
I have spent a considerable time in telecom industry from 2009 onwards focused on customer portals and customer self-service applications transitioning from development roles to leading and scaling multiple teams and then to solutions architecture for these applications. </p>
<p>
As I implemented process improvements with my teams in British Telecom transitioning to agile practices using Kanban practices for faster delivery, I got more interest in agile methodologies and culture. As I was mostly acting as a scrum master for my teams, I decided to advance my agile knowledge with CSM certification. In late 2014 I joined Xerox as Product Owner for their integration platform leading several integration projects with their managed enterprise clients in USA and Europe.</p>
<p>
After Xerox, I had a short stint with Moodyâ€™s Investor Services as a Business Analyst to try out other not so technical fields, which ended up being a good lesson learned that I do not enjoy a purely business role. 
</p>
<p>
I joined Comcast a Solutions Architect in 2016 and now leading solution architecture for Comcast Business self-service applications that enables over 4 million Comcast Business customers to manage their services online ranging from profile management, billing and payment system integration to manage their products. I am also working on enhancements towards REST microservices based architecture on cloud infrastructure and serverless technologies, event driven pub-sub architecture.</p>
<p>
As we are building solutions on AWS, I acquired AWS certification as a solution architect associate recently. I am interested to broaden my scope of work towards further into AWS & also expand into other cloud vendors given the opportunity.
